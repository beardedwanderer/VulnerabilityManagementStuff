# Vulnerability Management Stuff
This is a list of resources that may be helpful when building a new or evaluating an existing vulnerability management program. This is supplement to a presentation given at PancakesCon 2023. Initially this includes:
- a set of vulnerability management use cases, 
- a set of architecture "ilities", 
- some example vulnerability management architecture decisions that might need to be made, 
- a basic diagram of a vulnerability managment process and 
- a copy of the conference presentation.
