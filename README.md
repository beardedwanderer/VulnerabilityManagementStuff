# VulnerabilityManagementStuff
This is a list of resources that may be helpful when building a new or evaluating an existing vulnerability management program. This is supplement to a presentation given at PancakesCon 2023. Initially this includes a set of vulnerability management use cases, a set of architecture "ilities" and a copy of the conference presentation.
