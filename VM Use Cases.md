## Vulnerability Management Use Cases

I want to be able to discover assets 

I want to be able to import asset information programmatically 

I want to be able to set different scopes for asset discovery 

I want asset discovery to be separated from vulnerability scanning 

I want to be able to deduplicate multiple sources of asset information 

I want to be able scan multiple asset types including: physical machines (servers, workstations, networking devices, mobile devices, IoT devices), virtual machines, containers, applications, databases for vulnerabilities 

I want to be able to scan multiple asset OS types including: Microsoft, Linux, Unix, Macintosh OS, mobile OS, network device OS, IoT device OS 

I want to be able to scan with different scan policies e.g., only high and critical vulns, only recent vulns, only java vulns, only Microsoft vulns, etc. 

I want to be able to scan internal (not accessible from the internet) and external (internet exposed) assets 

I want to be able to schedule scans with any scope, frequency and policy as required by business objectives and security needs 

I want to be able to perform scans on demand with any scope, frequency and policy as required by business objectives and security needs 

I want to be able to perform authenticated scans 

I want to be able to perform unauthenticated scans 

I want to be able to limit the ability to perform asset discovery by role 

I want to be able to limit vulnerability scanning by role 

I want to be able to limit viewing of scan results by role 

I want to be able to access scan results in multiple formats including: machine readable, human readable and immutable 

I want to be able to access scan results in their original unmodified format directly from the vulnerability scanner 

I want to be able to validate the continued existence of previously discovered vulnerabilities on demand either by single vulnerability instance on a single asset or by multiple vulnerabilities on multiple assets 

I want to be able to provide self-service validation of vulnerability remediation on demand to authorized individuals and teams 

I want to be able to enhance vulnerability scan data with additional contextual information from external systems both programmatically and manually 

I want to be able to prioritize vulnerability severity based on contextual information including: CVSS score, exploitability score, asset criticality, asset location, asset group, team ownership, vulnerability density, etc. 

I want to be able to generate reports related to vulnerability scan results in both machine and human readable formats 

I want to be able to set and control most vulnerability scanner settings and activities via standard API calls 

I want to be able to enable vulnerability scanning via an agent or in an agentless manner as required 

I want to be able to manage vulnerability data retention according to business and regulatory requirements 

I want to be able to meet the requirements of all applicable regulatory and audit requirements including: NIST, FedRAMP, PCI, iRap, ISO, etc. 

I want to be able to centralize all vulnerability finding data into one centralized remediation and reporting process which, is the single source of truth for vulnerability data 

I want the ability to designate specific vulnerabilities as false positives by host, group of hosts, operating system, technology, etc. 

I want the ability to create scanning exceptions and exclusions by host, group of hosts, operating system, technology, etc. for specific periods of time and/or indefinitely
