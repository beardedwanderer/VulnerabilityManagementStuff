## Vulnerability Management Decisions

### Discovery & Inventory
- Will your discovery be automated or manual?
- Will your discovery be done by the same tool that does your vulnerability scanning?
- Do you have to do discovery at all?
- What systems are currently in place that might do or assist with the discovery process?
- Can you get someone else to provide an inventory?
- How often can you do discovery? Faster is better?

### Scanning
- What will be your deployment model for scanning?
  - Network or virtual appliance
  - Agent
  - Image or code repository
- Will you use only one scanning technology?
- How will you integrate the discovery & inventory process with your scanning?
- What will your scan frequency be?
- How will you manage scan policies?

### Prioritization
- What rubric / methodology will your utilize to prioritize your findings?
- Will risk, criticality, location be a consideration in your prioritization?
- Under what circumstances will you lower the criticality of a finding?
- How will you revalidate that previous risk decisions regarding criticality are still appropriate?

### Context & Attribution
- How will you know who is responsible for remediating a vulnerability?
- What other types of data do you need to gather to make vulnerabilities more meaningful / useful to your organization / security program?
- How will you handl inaccurate attribution?

### Ticketing
- Will ticketing be used to assign vulnerabilities?
- How will you handle ticket volume / duplication?
- Under what circumstances will a ticket be closed? Will it be manual or automatic?

### Validation & Exceptions
- How will you validate that a vulnerability has been remediated?
- Who can validate that a vulnerability has been remediated? Can this be done self service or on demand?
- Who will be allowed to submit and approve vulnerability exceptions?
- How often will vulnerability exceptions be reviewed?

### Metrics & Reporting
- What type of metrics will be used to measure the vulnerability management process?
- What types of reporting will be required? Who will be the audience for reports?
- How will you tie vulnerability information to business needs and objectives?
- Will your tools meet your reporting needs or will you need to purchase additional tooling specifically for reports?
- How often will reporting be provided and to whom?
